## Introduction to DSA

In this section, I cover the fundamentals of data structures and algorithms, including their importance, basic terminologies, and the role they play in problem-solving.

## Arrays

Detailed explanations and implementations of various array-related concepts, such as array manipulation, searching, sorting, and dynamic arrays.

## Linked Lists

Comprehensive coverage of linked list data structure, including singly linked lists, doubly linked lists, circular linked lists, and their applications.

## Stacks and Queues

Explanation and implementation of stack and queue data structures, along with their applications in real-world scenarios.

## Trees

In-depth discussion on tree data structure, including binary trees, binary search trees (BST), AVL trees, and various tree traversal techniques.

## Graphs

Understanding graph data structure, graph representations, graph traversal algorithms (DFS, BFS), and graph algorithms (shortest path, minimum spanning tree).

## Sorting Algorithms

Explanations and implementations of popular sorting algorithms such as bubble sort, insertion sort, selection sort, merge sort, quick sort, and their time complexity analysis.

## Searching Algorithms

Explanation of searching algorithms including linear search, binary search, interpolation search, and their applications.

## Dynamic Programming

Detailed coverage of dynamic programming techniques, including memoization, tabulation, and their applications in solving optimization problems.
